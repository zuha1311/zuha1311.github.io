      Coming Together stands on a very emotional and sensitive ground and therefore it was necessary to ensure that
      the data elicitation process is carried out without any form of presumptions. Our client wishes for his exhibition
      to become more
      “interactive” which can have a lot of meanings for different types of users. Our team, consisting of computer
      science, marketing
      and business backgrounds, unanimously decided that in order to understand the meaning of the word “interactive” we
      needed answers
      to the following questions: <br><br>

      1. Is “interaction” really the need?<br> <br>
      2. How do different groups of people perceive
      interaction? Is it bright colors or good content or
      something else?<br><br>
      3. What is the need for people to “interact” with
      Coming Together? <br>

      <b>A) Gather Domain Knowledge </b> <br>
      Domain knowledge was crucial
      to understand the vocabulary our client mentioned in his project brief, specifically, “brexit”,
      “mutually-beneficial relationships”,“southern european migrants” and “non-foreign born Scots”. It also helped us
      understand the goals,
      the online presence and the overall system architecture. <br> <br>
      <b> B) Gather Data Sources</b> <br>
      Since our data elicitation will be less rigorous, i.e, having budget and scheduling constraints and we need to
      perform rapid data elicitation, we decided on the following data sources:<br> <br>
      a. Observations of 5 users <br>
      b. Interview of the client, a photographer, a southern
      european migrant, a few Scotts and a product designer. <br>
      c. A short questionnaire for Southern European Migrants
      and the general public. <br> <br>

      The team and I conducted interviews of the client (since he was of himself of southern european heritage), a
      photographer who contributes to the exhibition, a few Scottish people and a web designer.
      Each interview was a semi-structred interview lasting 45 minutes. The main aim was to gain insights from different
      work roles and to understand the meaning of “interactive” platforms.

      <p> Apparently, from our analysis we concluded that it was not interaction that was the problem.<br> <br>
        <b>It was “engagement”. </b> <br><br>As evident from our observations, people did not know where to go or what
        to do.
        There is no sense of direction to guide the user to navigate through the website and make them stay.
        Due to the static nature of the website, users “lose interest” quite quickly.
        There is no area where users can contribute to the website. Until people are “engaged” with the website,
        “interaction” will be a secondary issue.

      <p style="text-align: left;"> Our client took our sugesstions into consideration and got them developed. We shadowed a UX designer while they A/B Testing on the site. The results were as follows: <br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The monthlly active users of the website grew from <b>2% to 7%</b> in 3 months.</li>
          <li>Time spent on the website increased from <b>2.7 minutes to more than 10 minutes</b> which shows that people starting interacting with more content on it.</li>
          <li>Usability tests showed that <b>75% people did not feel lost </b> and appreciated more media rather than more text.</li>
        </ul>

        This was my first experience of working in a team which taught me how important diverse views are. This project dealt a lot of with providing recommendations more than actually designing. 
        These recommendartions needed to be backed up with data and research which shows how differently users of a website perceive the journey as compared to designers and developers. 
        We were aiming to do A/B testing with the pages however due this project being part of an academic module did not provide the timeframe for us to do so. A future aspect for this project would be to do the same 
        and see if there any further changes in the MAU.
