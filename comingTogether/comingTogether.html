                    Coming together is an online exhibition that showcases and promotes the peace and harmony that
                    exists between Southern European Migrants and Non-foreign born Scottish people living in Edinburgh.
                    This exhibition was created after Brexit when an invisible barrier started appearing between the two
                    groups. It aims to promote this relationship in 3 broad areas: work, leisure and voluntary
                    associations. <br> <br>


                    Our client was just pushing one requirement when we met him in the kick off meeting, "Make the
                    website more interactive". He was also very keen on us to propose suggestions on how Coming together
                    can be more searchable on social media and more richer in material. <br><br>



                    Coming Together stands on a very emotional and sensitive ground and therefore it was necessary to
                    ensure that
                    the data elicitation process is carried out without any form of presumptions. Our client wishes for
                    his exhibition
                    to become more
                    “interactive” which can have a lot of meanings for different types of users. Our team, consisting of
                    computer
                    science, marketing
                    and business backgrounds, unanimously decided that in order to understand the meaning of the word
                    “interactive” we
                    needed answers
                    to the following questions: <br>


                <ul>
                    <li> Is “interaction” really the need? </li>
                    <li>Who are the main users of the website?</li>
                    <li> How do different groups of people perceive
                        interaction? Is it bright colors or good content or
                        something else? </li>
                    <li>What is the need for people to “interact” with
                        Coming Together?</li>

                </ul>

                    <h3><b>Goals</b></h3>
                    Below are the area I'd like to explore during user research. <br>
                    I want to understand: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the key bits of information users want to get out of the website?</li>
                        <li>The pattern of finding the information</li>
                        <li>The detail and depth of information the uses are looking for </li>
                        <li>Domain knowledge was crucial
                            to understand the vocabulary our client mentioned in his project brief, specifically,
                            “Brexit”,
                            “mutually-beneficial relationships”,“southern european migrants” and “non-foreign born
                            Scots”. It also helped us
                            understand the goals,
                            the online presence and the overall system architecture.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3><b>Methodologies</b></h3>
                    Since the data elicitation was less rigorous, i.e, having budget and scheduling constraints
                    the following methodologies were adopted:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Usability testing of the website with 5 users</li>
                        <li>1-1 semi structured interviews with the client, a photographer, a southern
                            european migrant, a few Scots and a product designer to understand what are they're
                            expectations from an online exhibition </li>
                        <li>A short questionnaire for Southern European Migrants
                            and the general public to understand what are they're
                            expectations from an online exhibition </li>
                    </ul>

                    The objective of the usability testing was to understand what people expect from the platform, how
                    they intend to use it and what scan paths do the users follow.
                    The following user groups were invited as participants for the usability testing sessions:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>New Visitors: </b>You are a first-time visitor to comingtogether.uk. Can you find the purpose
                        of the website and navigate to the relevant sections.</li>
                    <li><b>Event Seekers: </b>You are interested in attending an upcoming event related to diversity and
                        inclusion. Can you find event listings, filter events based on your preferences
                        (e.g., location, date, topic), and register for an event.</li>

                        Can you access community resources, engage in discussions, and contribute your

                        sponsoring

                    <ul>
                        <li>Brexit, COVID-19, and all the economic margin between the UK and other parts of Europe
                            (except Western Europe) have separated people with different ethnicities apart, causing the
                            migrants to face unfair treatments and unsafe environments from the locals. According to our
                            research on the interviewees, Brexit decreases the will for Southern Europeans to immigrate
                            to the UK while COVID-19 forced immigrants who had already been living in the country for
                            years to leave against their own will. With the impact of both incidents, we believe the
                            trend of ‘leaving the UK’ will accelerate even more in the future. Our client has spent tons
                            of effort trying to build a platform that brings the local Scottish and Southern European
                            immigrants living in Edinburgh together.

                        <li>In order for people to interact successfully with a system it is important to let them know
                            where to put emphasis on, which part of the website should catch one’s eye leading to a
                            successful user experience. Also, understanding user flows is very important as they bring
                            light on what people are doing now with the website and why they do what they do. A good
                            user interaction is only fruitful if it serves both business and user needs.</li>

                    Apparently, from our analysis we concluded that it was not interaction that was the problem. It was
                    “engagement”. As evident from our observations, people did not know where to go or what to do. There
                    is no sense of direction to guide the user to navigate through the website and make them stay. Due
                    to the static nature of the website, users “lose interest” quite quickly. There is no area where
                    users can contribute to the website. Until people are “engaged” with the website, “interaction” will
                    be a secondary issue.

                    The research part of this project and conversations with stakeholders provided enough information to

                    team and the wider graduation team were involved later on in the process due to lack of availability
                    of time in their calendars.

                        addition of 16 different ribbon colors being introduced for the new graduation season. </li>

                            <p>During the initial stages of the project there were 2 primary product owners who were
                                liaising regarding the requirements of the project. Further down the timeline, a number
                                of different stakeholders were introduced to us who were contributing in terms of
                                providing feedback. There was also the case of graduation team working with another UX
                                team to redesign the registration experience which was not communicated with us until
                                the later stages which means there was duplication of effort and work.

                                <b>Learnings:</b> Ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the kick off but
                                feedback will only be given by the product owners as too many opinions may cause more
                                harm than good

                            <p>As UX designers, we need to make sure that all user groups have a good experience with
                                the website and any edge cases can be handled as well. The secondary navigation bar was
                                a challenge, especially when it came to convincing stakeholders on how it will work and
                                how it can support edge cases of scenarios as well. </p>

                            <b>Learnings:</b> This would have been a good area for usability testing, however timelines
                            were very tight and dev work alone took 2-3 weeks. Moving forward, projects will be managed
                            in a way that can allow some time for usability testing with key user groups.

                            <p>This was a challenge because the team did want to provide information for future
                                graduation ceremonies, however we needed to create a journey for a "dark period" as well
                                i.e, when no information is available for either graduation ceremonies. We also wanted
                                to make sure that if a user is looking for a future graduation season they are able to
                                access it easily, hence it was decided to have it in the main nav bar.</p>

                <p>Overall this was one of the first large scale end to end projects that I worked on with the
                    university. I conducted proper 1-1 interviews, did usability testing and analyzed data and heatmaps
                    to make data driven design decisions.<br>What I would have appreciated is the opportunity to A/B
                    test
                    some of the components such as where do users prefer live steam links or is the off season
                    graduation season getting any form of interaction in the main nav bar. This area of the website will
                    be evolving continuously so it will be interesting to see if the new journey is being accepted by
                    users. <br>The primary stakeholder for this project did inform us that graduation queries have come
                    down by 87% in
                    2 months or so which is a drastic improvement and shows that users able to find the information they
                    are looking for. </p><br><br><br>
