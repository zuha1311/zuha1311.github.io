                    Coming together is an online exhibition that showcases and promotes the peace and harmony that
                    exists between Southern European Migrants and Non-foreign born Scottish people living in Edinburgh.
                    This exhibition was created after Brexit when an invisible barrier started appearing between the two
                    groups. It aims to promote this relationship in 3 broad areas: work, leisure and voluntary
                    associations. <br> <br>


                    Our client was just pushing one requirement when we met him in the kick off meeting, "Make the
                    website more interactive". He was also very keen on us to propose suggestions on how Coming together
                    can be more searchable on social media and more richer in material. <br><br>



                    Coming Together stands on a very emotional and sensitive ground and therefore it was necessary to
                    ensure that
                    the data elicitation process is carried out without any form of presumptions. Our client wishes for
                    his exhibition
                    to become more
                    “interactive” which can have a lot of meanings for different types of users. Our team, consisting of
                    computer
                    science, marketing
                    and business backgrounds, unanimously decided that in order to understand the meaning of the word
                    “interactive” we
                    needed answers
                    to the following questions: <br>


                <ul>
                    <li> Is “interaction” really the need? </li>
                    <li>Who are the main users of the website?</li>
                    <li> How do different groups of people perceive
                        interaction? Is it bright colors or good content or
                        something else? </li>
                    <li>What is the need for people to “interact” with
                        Coming Together?</li>

                </ul>

                    <h3><b>Goals</b></h3>
                    Below are the area I'd like to explore during user research. <br>
                    I want to understand: <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the key bits of information users want to get out of the website?</li>
                        <li>The pattern of finding the information</li>
                        <li>The detail and depth of information the uses are looking for </li>
                        <li>Domain knowledge was crucial
                            to understand the vocabulary our client mentioned in his project brief, specifically,
                            “Brexit”,
                            “mutually-beneficial relationships”,“southern european migrants” and “non-foreign born
                            Scots”. It also helped us
                            understand the goals,
                            the online presence and the overall system architecture.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3><b>Methodologies</b></h3>
                    Since the data elicitation was less rigorous, i.e, having budget and scheduling constraints
                    the following methodologies were adopted:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Usability testing of the website with 5 users</li>
                        <li>1-1 semi structured interviews with the client, a photographer, a southern
                            european migrant, a few Scots and a product designer to understand what are they're
                            expectations from an online exhibition </li>
                        <li>A short questionnaire for Southern European Migrants
                            and the general public to understand what are they're
                            expectations from an online exhibition </li>
                    </ul>

                    The objective of the usability testing was to understand what people expect from the platform, how
                    they intend to use it and what scan paths do the users follow.
                    The following user groups were invited as participants for the usability testing sessions:<br>
                <ul>

                        of the website and navigate to the relevant sections.</li>
                    <li><b>Event Seekers: </b>You are interested in attending an upcoming event related to diversity and

                    Brexit, COVID-19, and all the economic margin between the UK and other parts of Europe
                    (except Western Europe) have separated people with different ethnicities apart, causing the
                    migrants to face unfair treatments and unsafe environments from the locals. According to our
                    research on the interviewees, Brexit decreases the will for Southern Europeans to immigrate
                    to the UK while COVID-19 forced immigrants who had already been living in the country for
                    years to leave against their own will. With the impact of both incidents, we believe the
                    trend of ‘leaving the UK’ will accelerate even more in the future. Our client has spent tons
                    of effort trying to build a platform that brings the local Scottish and Southern European
                    immigrants living in Edinburgh together.

                    In order for people to interact successfully with a system it is important to let them know
                    where to put emphasis on, which part of the website should catch one’s eye leading to a
                    successful user experience. Also, understanding user flows is very important as they bring
                    light on what people are doing now with the website and why they do what they do. A good
                    user interaction is only fruitful if it serves both business and user needs.</li>

                    <h3><b>Pivot!</b></h3>
                    Apparently, from our analysis we concluded that it was not interaction that was the problem. It was
                    “engagement”. As evident from our observations, people did not know where to go or what to do. There
                    is no sense of direction to guide the user to navigate through the website and make them stay. Due
                    to the static nature of the website, users “lose interest” quite quickly. There is no area where
                    users can contribute to the website. Until people are “engaged” with the website, “interaction” will
                    be a secondary issue.

                        Engagement should be generated by the people who have contributed in building the website such
                        as the
                        photographers, website designers,
                        and the management team. A lot of users mentioned how interesting the theme of this website

                    <p>In the era of instagram, where content has become non-exhaustive and one can

                        A lot of the interviewees complained about the repetitive nature of the photographs and how the
                        pictures are
                        unable to convey a story that users are looking for.
                        The users complained that the photographs were not "colourful" enough which decreased the
                        engagement and

                    <p>There is lack of interactivity between the users and the website. As we mentioned earlier,
                        engagement is the
                        fundamental problem of this project since it caused most of the dismay, but interactivity can
                        inspire
                        engagement, which is something the website has failed to accomplish. The website lacks the
                        features of
                        allowing users to leave their presence onto the website, interacting with other visitors of the
                        website
                        including the Coming Together core team. There is also a lack of audio-video aid which makes it
                        difficult for
                        specially-challenged users to interact with the exhibition.
                        <br> The users for this area of interest mainly include visitors of the website which can be
                        broadly
                        classified based on their intent of visiting i.e, out of curiosity, to research, to contribute

                        accidental visit.

                    <p>While analyzing our interviews, we noticed how most of the participants of our study complained
                        about “too
                        many words”,
                        hence after some research, we landed on the term “Verbose” which means that a particular concept
                        is explained
                        in more words
                        that what is required, which perfectly captures our next area of interest. Even from a research
                        point of view,
                        where too much information is
                        good, most of the content on the website is repetitive which dilutes the purpose. The content
                        becomes
                        overwhelming for the visitors and hence it
                        fails to engage them. We aim to address this by slicing down the content, using structured texts
                        to improve
                        the readability. </p>

                The research part of this project and conversations with stakeholders provided enough information to
                determine which features will bring low vs high value to the user.

                            This made it difficult to produce high fidelity UI designs since we wanted to get feedback
                            on the wireframes before proceeding to UI.

            <p> Overall it was a very engaging and fun team effort. This was my first project that I did after fully
                understanding the UX process.
                It was nice to work with a dynamic team of diverse backgrounds such as marketing and business and
                understand their approach to solving problems since my background was that of a developer.
                The client in the end was very happy with the recommendations we had made and was trying to find a
                developer that would be able to implement those changes on the website.
                Last I spoke to him to check in on if the changes made were useful and he was delighted to tell me that
                there has been an average of 12% increase in MAU for the last 1 year which has significantly improved
                public contribution as well.
